					&nbsp;(Amsterdam, September 2016)
				</strong> 
				Hello! I am elwebman.nl. Thanks for clicking through.

				<strong> 
					<span style="color:blue">
						I live in Amsterdam and the city inspires me to make things.
						I am a multilingual (speak / read 4 languages ) with an eye on detail.

						I have a passion for design and like to combine this knowledge to create things. I think that innovation is not only creating new stuff but combining existing things and give them a new meaning.
						I love to engage with media and technology( like 3D printing ) and remain focused on gaining deep knowledge and expertise. When I first discovered 3D printing , I instantly felt in love with it. it empowers me, freeing me from the limitation of traditional manufacturing.

				<p>Enjoying everything about the gadget/tech/pc/IT/dev world. I think it&apos;s incredibly important to stay on top of technology, try out new stuff. I am multilingual with an eye on details and like to show what I am learning.
